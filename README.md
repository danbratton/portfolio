## [To Dodge or Not to Dodge?: Predicting League of Legends Match Outcomes](https://github.com/danbratton/portfolio/blob/master/To%20Dodge%20or%20Not%20to%20Dodge.ipynb)
The purpose of this study is to develop a model to predict the likelihood of a team winning a League of Legends match only using information available prior to the start of a match. The model would provide a recommendation to players to "dodge" a League of Legends match and avoid the consequences of defeat when the probability of victory is low enough such that the nominal LP loss from dodging the match is more beneficial to the player than attempting to win the match. This recommendation tool would increase player enjoyment of the game while working to optimize a player's LP gain per unit of time played.

## [NYU Course Selection Tool](https://github.com/danbratton/Course-Evaluations)
Oftentimes we need to make decisions using data from a wide variety of sources.  When done manually, this process can be error prone, time consuming, and frustrating.  This was exactly the case when I was reviewing which classes to take at NYU Stern while pursuing my MBA.  I had a list of available classes for the upcoming semester, but the course evaluations (reviews by students who took the class previously) were in a completely different place.  I combined the data by scraping both pages with Selenium, cleaned and combined the data with Pandas, and then published the resulting dataframe via a [Shiny web app](https://danbratton.shinyapps.io/XCourses/).
