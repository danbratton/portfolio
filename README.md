## [To Dodge or Not to Dodge?: Predicting League of Legends Match Outcomes](https://github.com/danbratton/portfolio/blob/master/To%20Dodge%20or%20Not%20to%20Dodge.ipynb)
The purpose of this study is to develop a model to predict the likelihood of a team winning a League of Legends match only using information available prior to the start of a match. The model would provide a recommendation to players to "dodge" a League of Legends match and avoid the consequences of defeat when the probability of victory is low enough such that the nominal LP loss from dodging the match is more beneficial to the player than attempting to win the match. This recommendation tool would increase player enjoyment of the game while working to optimize a player's LP gain per unit of time played.
